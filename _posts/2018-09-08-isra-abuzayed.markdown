description: Isra Abu Zayed is currently working on her Phd focusing on female education. As a university lecturer she has recently decided to take some time off to focus on herself and her family. She is often found imparting knowledge to her 5-year-old daughter on female empowerment and environmental sustainability. In her free time, Isra loves to embark on new creative projects such as, co-hosting the Hamburger Generation Podcast, meeting her peers for their book club discussions, or simply painting behind a canvas.
