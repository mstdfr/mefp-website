description: "Known for his thought-provoking lyrics and eccentric blend of English + عربي, Molham is a rising hip-hop artist from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

He launched his debut EP The Time Is Yesterday in March of 2018, with features from Egyptian starlet Malak El-Husseiny and Minneapolis-native Yusra J. The project serves as a window into his thoughts on regret, manifestation, and mood swings. The EP's breakout single Me Against the World hit the top hip-hop charts in the Middle East & North Africa, trending across 7 different countries.

Raised in Ontario, Canada, Molham shifts between two polar identities — one evening he’s eating كبسة on the floor of an uncle’s wedding, and the next he’s at a red carpet festival in Santa Monica. Inspired by his Middle Eastern culture and Western upbringing, he takes a best-of-both-worlds approach towards his songwriting, melodies, and visuals. Growing up, he spent high school Math classes writing rhymes for his classmates. Later during his college years, he performed at coffee shops, talent shows, and radio stations in a duo called 705B.

Beyond music, Molham is the founder of Kraytiv Entertainment Group — a Jeddah-based record label, content studio, and talent management agency. He is a writer for Forbes magazine and a savvy business strategist, having graduated with a degree in Finance and Economics from Georgetown University."
